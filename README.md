# Primes of Bad Reduction for Systems of Polynomial Equations

This repository contains the Maple worksheet used to compute explicit numerical upper bounds that appear in the proof of the main theorem of our paper.  

The paper provides asymptotic height bounds for several intermediate constructions and the main theorem. Writing and verifying all inequalities by hand would be lengthy, so this script gives an explicit upper bound with numerical examples.
